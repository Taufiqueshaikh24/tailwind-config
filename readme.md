# Simple Tailwind Starter

This is a simple Tailwind starter project using the Tailwind CLI. It is meant to be used as a starting point for your projects. 

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build or watch the CSS file:

```bash
# Build once
npm run dev

# Watch for changes
npm run watch
```

This will watch the `src/input.css` file and build it to `css/style.css`, which will be your final CSS file.
